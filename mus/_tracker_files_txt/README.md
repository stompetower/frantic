# Game music in .TXT format

This directory contains all music in readable `.TXT` format. 
The conversion from `.AMU` format to `.TXT` was done by [`amu2txt.py`](amu2txt.py), a little Python program.

The music data (notes, effects, etc.) is formatted in the same way as within the [music tracker RED](https://www.msx.org/news/software/en/anmas-red-music-recordereditor-available-for-download) that was used to create the music.
See the directory `mus/tracker_RED` for a manual of this music tracker.
